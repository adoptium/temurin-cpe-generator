# Temurin CPE Generator

A tool to generate a CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) directory entries for Eclipse Temurin using the Adoptium API.

## Overview

This tool adheres to the NIST CPE design specification, keeping it simple and in a format that can be easily generated by scripts. The goal is to represent each Temurin release product. The specification for these entries can be found [here](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-cpe-generator/blob/spec/SPECIFICATION.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 18 or higher recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-cpe-generator
    cd temurin-cpe-generator
    ```

1. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. To fetch all the GA releases and generate the CPE directory:

    ```bash
    node generator.js
    ```

1. The output will be an XML format representation, which you can save or further process as needed.

## Features

- Fetches all GA releases from the Adoptium API with pagination support.
- Generates CPE items in the required XML format.

## Implementation Notes

- The title is derived as "Eclipse Temurin" followed by a substring of the release name.
- For JDK8, the version is static "1.8.0", and the update field uses the release name after "jdk8u".
